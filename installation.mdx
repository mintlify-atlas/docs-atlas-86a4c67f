# Installation

OpenTUI is available as an npm package and can be installed with any JavaScript package manager. This guide covers installation, system requirements, and verification steps.

## System requirements

Before installing OpenTUI, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

### Required

- **Zig compiler** - OpenTUI requires [Zig](https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/) to build the native core
- **Bun 1.3.0+** (recommended), Node.js 18+, or another JavaScript runtime

<Note>
You must have Zig installed on your system to build OpenTUI packages. Visit the [Zig installation guide](https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/) for platform-specific instructions.
</Note>

### Supported platforms

OpenTUI provides pre-built binaries for:

- macOS (x64, ARM64)
- Linux (x64, ARM64)
- Windows (x64, ARM64)

## Install OpenTUI

Choose your preferred package manager to install the core OpenTUI package:

<CodeGroup>
```bash bun
bun install @opentui/core
```

```bash npm
npm install @opentui/core
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @opentui/core
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @opentui/core
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
We recommend using [Bun](https://bun.sh) for the best development experience with OpenTUI. Bun provides faster installation, built-in TypeScript support, and is the primary runtime used by the OpenTUI team.
</Tip>

## Framework packages

OpenTUI provides framework-specific packages for React and SolidJS:

<CodeGroup>
```bash React
bun install @opentui/react
```

```bash SolidJS
bun install @opentui/solid
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
Framework packages automatically include `@opentui/core` as a dependency.
</Note>

## Verify installation

Create a simple test file to verify your installation:

```typescript test.ts
import { createCliRenderer, TextRenderable } from "@opentui/core"

const renderer = await createCliRenderer()

const text = new TextRenderable(renderer, {
  id: "test",
  content: "OpenTUI is working!",
  fg: "#00FF00",
  position: "absolute",
  left: 2,
  top: 2,
})

renderer.root.add(text)
```

Run the test file:

<CodeGroup>
```bash bun
bun run test.ts
```

```bash node
node test.ts
```
</CodeGroup>

You should see green text displayed in your terminal. Press `Ctrl+C` to exit.

## Quick start with create-tui

The fastest way to get started is using the [create-tui](https://github.com/msmps/create-tui) scaffolding tool:

```bash
bun create tui
```

This interactive CLI will:

1. Prompt you for project configuration
2. Set up a new OpenTUI project with best practices
3. Install dependencies automatically
4. Provide example code to get started

## Try examples without installation

You can explore OpenTUI examples without cloning the repository:

<CodeGroup>
```bash macOS/Linux/WSL
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anomalyco/opentui/main/packages/core/src/examples/install.sh | sh
```

```bash Windows
# Download from GitHub Releases
# Visit: https://github.com/anomalyco/opentui/releases/latest
```
</CodeGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Zig not found

If you see an error about Zig not being found:

1. Install Zig from [ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/](https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/)
2. Ensure `zig` is in your PATH
3. Verify installation: `zig version`

### Build errors

If you encounter build errors:

1. Ensure you have the latest version of Zig
2. Clear your package manager cache
3. Try reinstalling dependencies

<CodeGroup>
```bash bun
rm -rf node_modules bun.lockb
bun install
```

```bash npm
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```
</CodeGroup>

### Platform-specific binaries

OpenTUI automatically downloads platform-specific binaries. If you're on an unsupported platform, you may need to build from source. See the [Development Guide](https://github.com/anomalyco/opentui/blob/main/packages/core/docs/development.md) for instructions.
