# Introduction

OpenTUI is a native terminal UI core written in Zig with TypeScript bindings. The native core exposes a C ABI and can be used from any language. OpenTUI powers [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) in production today and will also power [terminal.shop](https://terminal.shop). It is an extensible core with a focus on correctness, stability, and high performance.

## Key features

OpenTUI provides a component-based architecture with flexible layout capabilities, allowing you to create complex terminal applications:

- **Native performance** - Written in Zig with a focus on correctness and high performance
- **Component-based architecture** - Build UIs with reusable, composable components
- **Flexible layouts** - Uses the Yoga layout engine for CSS Flexbox-like capabilities
- **Cross-language support** - C ABI allows usage from any language
- **Rich components** - Text, boxes, inputs, selects, tabs, and more
- **Advanced rendering** - FrameBuffer API for custom graphics and visual effects
- **Built-in console** - Integrated debug console with log capture
- **Theme support** - Automatic dark/light mode detection
- **Production-ready** - Powers OpenCode in production

## Quick example

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```typescript
import { createCliRenderer, TextRenderable } from "@opentui/core"

const renderer = await createCliRenderer()

const greeting = new TextRenderable(renderer, {
  id: "greeting",
  content: "Hello, OpenTUI!",
  fg: "#00FF00",
  position: "absolute",
  left: 10,
  top: 5,
})

renderer.root.add(greeting)
```

<Tip>
Use [create-tui](https://github.com/msmps/create-tui) to quickly scaffold a new OpenTUI project:

```bash
bun create tui
```
</Tip>

## Why OpenTUI?

OpenTUI combines the best of both worlds: native performance through Zig with the developer experience of TypeScript. The architecture provides:

- **Correctness** - Type-safe APIs with comprehensive error handling
- **Stability** - Battle-tested in production with OpenCode
- **Performance** - Native Zig core for maximum efficiency
- **Extensibility** - Component-based design for easy customization
- **Flexibility** - Works with React, SolidJS, or imperative APIs
